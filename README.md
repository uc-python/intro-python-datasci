### Course Description

Welcome to Introduction to Python for Data Science! This short course provides a gentle, hands-on introduction to the Python programming language for data science applications. You will learn the fundamentals of Python as a language and how to work with data using the `pandas` library.

### Objectives

The following are the primary learning objectives of students:

1. Develop comprehensive skills in the importing/exporting, wrangling, aggregating and joining of data using Python.

2. Establish a mental model of the Python programming language to enable future self-learning.

3. Build awareness and basic skills in the core data science area of data visualization.

### Agenda

***Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, this workshop offering will be 100% virutal and span 4 half-days.***

### Course Preparation

In an effort to simplify the setup for this class, we are using Binder for all materials (slides, worksheets, etc.). In result, there is no pre-requisite installation required for the in-class material.

With that being said, it's smart to install the appropriate technologies and download the materials anyways. This will provide you a backup in case there are network issues, and *it will also be required to apply your learnings outside of class*.

Follow these steps to download the technologies and materials:

#### 1. Python, Jupyter and package installation.

These easiest way to install Python, Jupyter, and the necessary packages is through Anaconda. To download and install Anaconda:

1. Visit the [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. Select your appropriate operating system
3. Click the "Download" button for Python 3.7 - this will begin to download the Anaconda installer
4. Open the installer when the download completes, and then follow the prompts. If you are prompted about installing PyCharm, elect **not** to do so.
5. Once installed, open the Anaconda Navigator and launch a Jupyter Notebook to ensure it works.
6. Follow [the package installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-packages/#installing-a-package) to ensure `pandas` and `seaborn` packages are installed.

#### 2. Download class materials

There are two ways to download the class materials:

1. Clone it - If you're familiar with how to do so, you can clone this repository.
2. Download the files as a zip - use [this link](https://github.com/uc-python/intro-python-datasci/archive/master.zip)
